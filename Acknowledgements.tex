\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to start by expressing my gratitude towards 
my supervisor Alan Lauder.  While encouraging me to work 
on the topic of this thesis he has given me a lot of freedom, 
allowing me to combine the theoretical aspects of this subject 
with my interest in programming.

In addition, I would also like to thank George Walker for his 
guidance and help throughout the initial period of my DPhil 
research.  During the final two years, Jan Tuitman's joining 
of the research group accelerated my progress significantly.

In the context of my computational work, I would like thank 
Bill Hart and Fredrik Johansson, co-developers of the software 
package {\sc{FLINT}}, for the tremendous amount of effort in 
producing the {\sc{FLINT 2}} series and the many stimulating 
discussions.  I would also like extend my thanks to William Stein 
for the many invitations to workshops related to the software package 
{\sc{Sage}}.

Finally, I would like to thank the European Research Council, 
who supported this work financially through the grant awarded 
to Alan Lauder.
